Ship of Theseus
Imagine a famous ship, the Ship of Theseus, which is kept in a museum. Over time, as parts of the ship begin to decay, they are replaced with exact replicas. Eventually, every single part of the ship is replaced. The question then arises: is this fully restored ship still the Ship of Theseus?

To add another layer, suppose all the original parts that were removed are reassembled into another ship. Is this second ship now the Ship of Theseus, or is the restored one still deserving of the name?

This paradox raises questions about identity, change, and what it means for something to be the same object over time.
